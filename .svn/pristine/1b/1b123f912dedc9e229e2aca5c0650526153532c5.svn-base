<h1 align="center">SCoPE plug-in: XML interface</h1>
<hr>
<p>SCoPE is a SystemC exension for system modeling based on approximately (loosely) timed descriptions of the system components. As a SystemC extension library, SCoPE has been designed to receive the system descriptions as SystemC code. However, in order to minimize the designer effort, a easier interface for describing the systems is required. This plug-in has been prepared to accept the system descriptions in a friendly format (XML) and automatically generate the SystemC code required. The sc_main function, component instaciation and connections are created automatically.</p>
<hr>
<p>The plug-in requires only <em>SCoPE v1</em>
and <em>g++4.x</em>. 
Furthermore, it is mandatory to acomplish the SCoPE requirements. 
<li>SCoPE required libraries: 
<pre>	SystemC2.x</pre>
</li>
<li>SCoPE required environment variables:
<pre>	$SCOPE_HOME : 	Path to SCoPE library
	$SYSTEMC:	Path to SystemC
