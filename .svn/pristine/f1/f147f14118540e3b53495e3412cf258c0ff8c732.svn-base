 * \brief This class is used to manage the HW addresses
 *
 * Every bus or peripheral has to inherit this class as a standard and automatic
 * way to store and manage the addresses. Each peripheral has a range of addresses
 * which is stored in this class. Then, it can be used to obtain a complete memory map
 * of the peripherals connected to a specific object by calling the generate_memory_map
 * function. Commonly, this feature is used by a bus to create the memory map to know
 * how to route the received packets.
