======  Instructions and requirements for SCoPE installation  ======
====================================================================

SCoPE is a SystemC based co-simulation library. Hardware models are
simulated by connecting them to the TLM bus available. Application
software is simulated by parsing, compiling and linking against SCoPE
with a minimum effort from the software developer.

=== Requirements ===

	- GNU C/C++ compiler > 4.0
	- SystemC 2.2
	- flex 2.5.33
	- bison (GNU bison) 2.3

=== Environment variables ===

Edit your .bash_profile or .bashrc file and add the next environment variables:

	CXX=g++
	SCOPE_HOME=/path/to/scope
	SYSTEMC=/path/to/systemc

Add the $(SCOPE_HOME)/bin folder to your PATH

=== Make and Install ===

To compile the library, including the utils and graphic interface, type:

	$> make all

The library "libscope.a" is located into the $(SCOPE_HOME)/scope directory. To
compile the test provided with the library:

	$> make test

Examples are located in the $(SCOPE_HOME)/test directory.

=== Notes ===

Using SCoPE under CygWin is not suported. Use it at your own risk.
